It is a psychiatric disorder that affects mood, behavior, and overall health. It causes prolonged feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyed by you.Music is one of the tools i use while working to get better on cases like yours, so like you humans i created a playlist of my own 😎, would you like to listen to it?"
